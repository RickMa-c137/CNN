It's my honor to introduce the mini project "neural network sample" to you.

If you try to use it, you must follow below steps:

0.Open this project via IDEA/EClipse

1.Write number(0~9) into the rectangle, then click "tell num" to tell software the number you have written. 

2.Repeate step 1 five hundred times or more, then go to step 3

3.Click "train" button and wait training complete

4.Write number(0~9) into the rectangle, then click "test". The software will tell you the number it thought you write.
